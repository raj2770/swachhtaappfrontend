**What is the computation problem from SDG goals?**

Goal 13 - Climate Action

Goal 14 - Life below Water

Goal 15 - Life on Land


==============================================================================

**What are the existing solutions and why they don’t work?**

Irregularities in the garbage dump collection don’t set on the same page with the already set schedule and behavioural aspect of the people.

Lack of awareness	
Interaction of Govt/Ngo with people 
Laziness of people 
Lengthy/Complex process


==============================================================================

**What is your proposed solution?**

One - click solution

This just like sending photo from camera in whatsapp, where user have to just click a photo of garbage dump area and then send it rest all the things will be handled by the app.

We will send the pic to the nearest municipal corporation or concerned department
And also give points to user for every pic send

Way  forward 
Can be extended with different domains like education in govt school
Features such as rating,review,priority to mc  etc

==============================================================================


**What technologies will you use to implement the solution?**

Android Studio
Web scraping
Java
Rest API


==============================================================================

**How will you evaluate your Solution?**

This will be a people participative solution as that’s what the goal is all about, only from the govt side this won’t work. So we need an easy solution else people won’t come forward.
We can then take the feedback from our users.
We will make user friendly interface.
